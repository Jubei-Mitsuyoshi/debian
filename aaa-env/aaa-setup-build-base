  Currently this script takes no

  may setup a custom tmpfs dir at 
  $aaa_tmpfs_location ( depending on
  the settings in /usr/share/aaa/aaa-master-config
  the size can be configured in 
  /usr/share/aaa/aaa-master-config
  It will also setup your personal
  gpg key for auto package signing
  if you desire
