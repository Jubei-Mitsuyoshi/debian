CPyrit-CUDA
+++++++++++++

A sub-package that adds CUDA-capability to Pyrit. Please see the main README
for more information about Pyrit.

http://code.google.com/p/pyrit/



Requirements
++++++++++++

CPyrit-CUDA compiles and runs on Linux and MacOS. Windows is not (and
probably never will be) supported; there are however some reports of successful
installations on Windows with the help of MinGW.

A couple of libraries and headers are required to build CPyrit-CUDA:

  * Python >=2.5 and it's headers
    http://www.python.org
  * The OpenSSL library and headers
    http://www.openssl.org
  * The ZLib library and headers
    http://www.zlib.net
  * The Nvidia drivers and the Nvidia CUDA-Toolkit (not the so called SDK)

Linux users running a binary distribution may need to install the development
packages for Python (e.g. python-devel), OpenSSL (e.g. openssl-devel or
libssl-dev) and ZLib (e.g. zlib-devel). You also need a C-compiler like gcc.
Users of MacOS probably only need to have XCode installed.

By default, setup.py looks into '/usr/local/cuda' and '/opt/cuda' to find the
CUDA-headers and the compiler. Modify setup.py if you have those installed
elsewhere.



Installing
++++++++++

Unpack the source-code into a new directory like this:

    tar xvzf cpyrit-cuda-0.4.0.tar.gz


Switch to the module's directory. We use Python's distutils to compile and
install the code:

    cd cpyrit-cuda-0.4.0
    python setup.py build


If everything went well and no errors are thrown at you, use distutils again to
install CPyrit-CUDA:

    sudo python setup.py install


You should see your CUDA-capable devices listed when executing
'pyrit list_cores'.



Reporting bugs / Getting help
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Please take a look at the Troubleshooting-page in Pyrit's Wiki if you have
problems compiling or running Pyrit:
