----------------------------| Issues |-------------------------------

- When you are gathering word lists into one folder, filtering a 
	folder will also filter sub-folders of that folder.

- When you prefix or append a word list certain characters e.x. ~ or
	or combinations of characters  e.x. /\ do not work

- The ASCII conversion tool does not convert all text formats

- The reverse feature will not work if there are non-ASCII chars

- The duplicate and mirror functions require 3x the space of the HDD
	original word list because of the temp files they create

- Special characters do not work with most features currently

- The logging feature will create incredibly large logs if you use 
	it with the Random word list creation tool
