xinit (1.0.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The /etc/X11/xinit/xserverrc script has been changed so that xinit and
    startx do not pass -dpi 100 to the X server anymore. xserver-xorg-core
    now uses 96 instead of 75 by default, it should be fine for most people.
    In case of problem, the DisplaySize option be used in the Monitor
    section of your /etc/X11/xorg.conf to force another DPI. If you
    have multiple RandR 1.2 outputs, DisplaySize should be specified
    in each Monitor section.
