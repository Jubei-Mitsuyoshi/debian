These fontconfig configuration files are intended to be used in conjunction 
with the freetype-infinality subpixel hinting patch at:

  http://www.infinality.net/

Windows, OSX, Google, and Linux fonts are included in the rules along with 
other misc popular or useful fonts found on the web.

Feel free to propose additions, changes and questions regarding this 
configuration at:

  http://www.infinality.net/forum/

If you have a favorite font that is not included or not rendered properly, 
please let me know and I'll try to fix and include it.



HOW TO USE THIS CONFIGURATION
=============================

1) Unzip fontconfig-infinality into /etc/fonts/.  Note that there should be 
no subfolder called /etc/fonts/fontconfig-infinality/.  It should go in 
/etc/fonts/.

2) Ensure /etc/fonts/conf.d/ contains a symlink 52-infinality.conf which 
points to /etc/fonts/infinality/infinality.conf

3) Adjust various settings in /etc/fonts/infinality/infinality.conf to personal 
taste.

4) Change rendering style with the symlink /etc/fonts/infinality/conf.d to 
personal taste.

/etc/fonts/local.conf should either not exist, or have no infinality-related 
configurations in it.  The local.conf is now obsolete and completely replaced 
by this configuration.



HOW TO CREATE YOUR OWN CUSTOM RENDERING STYLE
=============================================

1) Clone a directory inside styles.conf.avail.  For instance, if you want to 
start out with the base style as "win7" and name the new style "custom", 
do this as root:

  cd /etc/fonts/infinality/styles.conf.avail
  cp -Rp win7 custom

2) Enter the "custom" directory and view it / examine the files you want to 
change:

  cd custom
  ls -la

3) For files you want to change, remove the symlink and copy the actual file 
over.  (Or, if you'd like to make an addition to a style, create a new file 
instead of copying and removing.)  For instance, if you want to change the os 
replacements for Windows 7 in 41-repl-os-win.conf, do this:

  cp 41-repl-os-win.conf 41-repl-os-custom.conf
  rm 41-repl-os-win.conf

  Now you have a local copy of this file that will not be overwritten after 
any updates.

4) Make your modifications.  For instance, if you want to make serif fonts get 
replaced with "Georgia" instead of "Times New Roman", find these lines and 
modify them appropriately:

  <edit name="family" mode="prepend" binding="strong">
    <string>Times New Roman</string> 
  </edit>

5) Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each file you would like to customized.  Future 
updates to fontconfig-infinality will not overwrite your customizations, and 
will include any updates to other non-customized files, because those files 
are being linked from /etc/fonts/infinality/conf.src/.

6) Run infctl.sh to set the style:

  cd /etc/fonts/infinality
  ./infctl.sh setstyle custom

7) Any program that uses fontconfig (which is most of them) will now render
things according to the "custom" style you have created.
